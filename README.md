# Godot-Prototype

** as of August 2018 deprecated: see now https://github.com/godot-gazetteer **

The aim of this graph database system is to create and maintain a gazetteer of calendar dates in different calendar systems used in the Greek and Roman antiquity all across the mediterranean sea. Like geographical gazetteers this authority list can be used to provide stable, unique identifiers (URIs) for each date in any of the calendar systems that has been used to refer to an astronomical day in any ancient source, be it papyri, ostraca or inscriptions. It will serve as a means to search and browse ancient texts by their precise temporal footprint using these URIs in digital editions and database or TEI/EpiDoc XML driven projects. 
Where a clear system of conversions between different calendar systems has been established, dates will be converted algorithmically into (proleptic) Julian calendar and Julian Day Numbers. As more and more dates from antiquity are linked to the GODOT infrastructure, a complex knowledge graph of ancient dated objects and texts evolves.
